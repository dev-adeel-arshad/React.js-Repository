-------------< INTERVIEW QUESTION <><><><><><><><><>

#<><><>Q1<><><> : what willl happen we write the vaue of counter as
setCounter(counter + 1)
setCounter(counter + 1)
setCounter(counter + 1)
setCounter(counter + 1)  will its value be uncreased to 19 after
 oneclick or not as they are written in same function of addValue?

::::::Answer::::  <>  no as we will click on add value its value will be updated by 1 only. 


:<><><><><>:NOTE::<><><><><>  to that we have to put previous vlaue in a function
 and keep in mind that it takes call back function and return a value.
  as i have used prevCounter but u can use counter etc

----> when the code will be written as in following example now on one click
 the value will be updated by 4.
   
    setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1)
    setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1 )
    setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1)
    setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1)
